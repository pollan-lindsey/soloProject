<p>Difficulty: 5.8</p>
<p>First competed successfully by Korean gymnast Yeo Seojeong at the 2019 Korea Cup, the Yeo is a Handspring fwd on – 
    stretched salto fwd with 2/1 twist (720°) off. It is one of the most difficult vaults in the world.</p>
<p>Bonus Fact: In men’s artistic gymnastics, this skill is named after her father, Yeo Hong-chul. </p>

<h3 class="martins">The Martins (Unveven Bars)</h3>
<p>Difficulty: F </p>
<p>First competed successfully by Portuguese gymnast Ana Filipa Martins at the 2021 European Championships, 
the Martins is a clear hip circle on HB with counter straddle over the HB with ½ turn (180°) to hang in mixed L-grip.  </p>
<p>Common Name: Hindorff ½ </p>
<p>Bonus Fact: Martins is the first Portuguese gymnast to get a skill named after her.</p>

<h3 class="derwael-fenton">The Derwael-Fenton (Uneven Bars)</h3>
<p>Difficulty: F</p>
<p>First competed successfully by British gymnast Georgia-Mae Fenton and Belgian gymnast Nina Derwael at the 2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships, 
the Derwael-Fenton is a stalder bwd on HB with counter straddle reverse hecht over HB with ½ (180°) turn to hang in mixed L-grip.</p>

<h3 class="sugihara">The Sugihara</h3>
<p>Difficulty: E</p>
<p>First competed successfully by Japanese gymnast Sugihara Aiko at the 2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships, 
the Sugihara is 2/1 turn (720°) with free leg held upward in 180° split position throughout turn.</p>
<p>Common Name: Memmel on beam</p>
<p>Bonus Fact: Because it is a dance skill, the highest difficulty the Sugihara can have is an E.
    However many gymnastics fans feel that it is too difficult to be considered an E-difficulty skill. 
    The same skill on the floor (Memmel) has a D-difficulty. </p>

<p>First competed successfully by Puerto Rican gymnast Andrea Maldonado at the 2019 Cottbus World Cup,
