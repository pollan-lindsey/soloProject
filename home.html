                <p>In gymnastics, the code of points (CoP) is a handbook of rules, regulations, and skills for each event, 
    which is updated every Olympic cycle (the year after the summer Olympics until the year of the next summer Olympics). 
    It is mostly used by judges, coaches, and random people on the internet with too much time on their hands (read: me). 
    The Olympic cycle is sometimes referred to as a quad, since the Olympics are every four years).
    However, since the 2020 Olympics were postponed due to Covid-19, the current CoP will only be effective for three years. 
    This website will cover every new eponymous skill from Simone Biles (including one she was not able to get named after her), 
    and 5 new, difficult elements from other gymnasts. </p>

        <div class="d-element"> 
            <h4 class="section">What qualifies as a "difficult" element?</h4>
                <p> For most of womenâ€™s artistic gymnastics (WAG) history, the highest score a gymnast could get on an event was a 10.0. 
    However, in 2007 the international gymnastics governing body, FIG, created an open-ended code, 
    separating the execution score (which is scored out of 10) from the difficulty score (which is open-ended). 
    This allows gymnasts to be rewarded for competing more difficult skills. 
    Difficulty on vault ranges from 1.0 to 6.0, difficulty on uneven bars (UB) ranges from A-G, difficulty on balance beam (BB) ranges from A-H,
    and the difficulty on floor exercise (FX) ranges from A-J. However, the highest difficulty on each event can be raised 
    at any time due to the open-ended code. This unfortunately does not include dance elements (leaps, turns, jumps, hops, and, on BB, rolls),
    which have a difficulty cap of E. The elements covered on this website are all E+ difficulty on BB, UB, and FX and 5.8+ difficulty on vault.</p>

        <div class="eponymous">
            <h4 class="section">What is an eponymous skill?</h4>
                <p>An eponymous skill is a skill named after the gymnast who first performed it successfully at an international competition.
    Prior to the 2017-20 CoP, the skill had to be performed at either World Championships or the Olympics to officially be in the CoP.
    However, starting in 2017, a gymnast can get the skill named at any FIG competition, including FIG world cups and continental championships. 
    Also starting in 2017, skills could be named after multiple gymnasts if they compete it at the same competition. Prior to this rule, 
    the skill would simply not be named in the CoP. In addition, the skill, description of the skill, and a video of the gymnast training 
    the skill must be presented by the coaches to the judges prior to the competition. The gymnast must also land the skill.</p>
