    <h3 class="acronym">Acronyms:</h3>
    <p>BB = balance beam</p>
    <p>FX = floor exercise</p>
    <p>UB = uneven bars</p>
    <p>WAG = women's artistic gymnastics</p>
    <p>FIG = International Gymnastics Federation</p>
    <p>CoP = code of points</p>
    
    <h3 class="biles-skill">The Biles (Vault)</h3>
    <p>Difficulty: 6.0</p>
    <p>First competed internationally at the 2018 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships, 
    the Biles (vault) is a round off Flic-flac with ½ turn (180°) on – stretched salto fwd with 2/1 twist (720°) off.</p>
    <p>Common name: Cheng 1/2</p>
    <p>Bonus Fact: The Biles is the tied with the Produnova for the highest difficulty value in a vault</p>

    <h3 class="biles-skill">The Biles (Balance Beam)</h3>
    <p>Difficulty: H</p>
    <p>Common name: double double dismount</p>
    <p>First competed internationally at the 2019 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships, 
        the Biles (BB) is a double salto bwd tucked with 2/1 twist (720°).</p>
    <p>Bonus fact: Biles herself thought this skill was undervalued (rightfully so) and soon, 
        even people who did not normally care about gymnastics were outraged. 
        The same skill on FX has the same difficulty rating despite one being competed on a spring floor, 
        and the other (the Biles dismount) being competed off the end of a 4 inch wide block of wood. 
        FIG clarified that the reason it was given the ranking was for the safety of other gymnasts who would want to compete it if it was given a higher difficulty.

    <h3 class="biles-skill">The Biles II (Floor Exercise)</h3>
    <p>Difficulty: J</p>
    <p>First competed internationally at the 2019 Artistic Gymnastics World championships, 
    the Biles II is a double salto bwd tucked with 3/1 twist (1080°).</p>
    <p>Common name: triple double</p>
    <p>Bonus fact: This is the second skill Simone Biles has named after her on this apparatus. The other one was first competed in the 2013-16 quad. 
    This has a higher difficulty than any other element in the CoP.</p>

    <h3 class="biles-skill">Not in the CoP: The Biles II (Vault)</h3>
    <p>Projected difficulty: 6.6 (2017-20 CoP); 6.2 (2022-24 CoP)</p>
    <p>Common name: Yurchenko double pike</p>
    <p>Competed only at the U.S. Classic (not an FIG competition) in 2021, 
        the “Biles II” is a round off Flic-flac on - piked double salto bwd off.
        Due to a dangerous mental block, she was unable to compete it at the 2020 Olympics and therefore, was never
        able to get this incredible skill in the CoP. 
        It is unlikely Biles will return to elite gymnastics but she has “not counted out” returning for the Paris Olympics in 2024.
        With any luck, we will get to see it again then, and she will get it named after her in the CoP.
