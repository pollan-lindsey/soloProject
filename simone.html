        <p>Difficulty: 6.0</p>
        <br>
        <p>First competed internationally at the 2018 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships, 
    the Biles (vault) is a round off Flic-flac with ½ turn (180°) on – stretched salto fwd with 2/1 twist (720°) off.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Common name: Cheng 1/2</p>
        <br>
        <p>Bonus Fact: The Biles is the tied with the Produnova for the highest difficulty value in a vault</p>

        <p>Common name: double double dismount</p>
        <br>
        <p>First competed internationally at the 2019 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships, 
        the Biles (BB) is a double salto bwd tucked with 2/1 twist (720°).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Bonus fact: Biles herself thought this skill was undervalued, and rightfully so.
        The same skill on FX has the same difficulty rating (H) despite one being competed on a spring floor, 
        and the other (the Biles dismount) being competed off the end of a 4 inch wide block of wood.

        <p>First competed internationally at the 2019 Artistic Gymnastics World championships, 
        the Biles II is a double salto bwd tucked with 3/1 twist (1080°).</p>
        <br>
        <p>Common name: triple double</p>
        <br>
        <p>Bonus fact: This is the second skill Simone Biles has named after her on this apparatus. The other one (the first skill in the above video) was first competed in the 2013-16 quad. 
        This has a higher difficulty than any other element in the CoP.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Common name: Yurchenko double pike</p>
        <br>
        <p>Competed only at the U.S. Classic (not an FIG competition) in 2021, 
        the “Biles II” is a round off Flic-flac on - piked double salto bwd off.
        Due to a dangerous mental block, she was unable to compete it at the 2020 Olympics and therefore, was never
        able to get this incredible skill in the CoP. 
        It is unlikely Biles will return to elite gymnastics but she has “not counted out” returning for the Paris Olympics in 2024.
        With any luck, we will get to see it again then, and she will get it named after her in the CoP.
